Working at a small company is great, but I don't get much time to develop effective marketing strategies.

I keep reading about how generative AI is transforming the business landscape.  So a few months ago I started investigating how small businesses use this technology to help day-to-day business operations.  

One topic that kept coming up were "no-code" automation tools.  I had never heard of this before.  They give non-programmers the power to conveniently build powerful software systems by combining popular APIs, services, and tools together in a simple drag-and-drop interface.  

The 3 most popular no-code platforms on the market today are  

* [make.com](https://www.make.com/en)
* [zapier](https://zapier.com/)
* [n8n](https://n8n.io/)

So far, I've used make.com to build out a simple content management/generation system with Google Sheets and the OpenAI API.  Overall, the process was pretty easy.  But I like to program, so I looked around for some alternatives.          

##  Trigger.dev

[Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev/) is a newer automation tool
