A few months ago I started investigating how small businesses use generative AI to help with content generation, marketing, and business development.  One thing that kept coming up were "no-code" automation tools.  They give non-programmers the power to conveniently build powerful software systems by combining popular APIs, services, and tools together in a simple drag-and-drop interface.       

The 3 most popular no-code platforms on the market today are  

* [make.com](https://www.make.com/en)
* [zapier](https://zapier.com/)
* [n8n](https://n8n.io/)



## My First Make.com Automation

My first Make.com scenario helped me design a little content management system for a series of articles describing previous projects I've worked on.
