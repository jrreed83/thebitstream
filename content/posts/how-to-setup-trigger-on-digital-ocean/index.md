A few months ago I started investigating how small businesses use generative AI for content generation, marketing, and business development.  One topic that kept coming up were "no-code" automation tools.  I had never heard of this before.  They give non-programmers the power to conveniently build powerful software systems by combining popular APIs, services, and tools together in a simple drag-and-drop interface.  

I like to program, but I have very little time to work on this type of software.  So I decided to give these tools a try.         

The 3 most popular no-code platforms on the market today are  

* [make.com](https://www.make.com/en)
* [zapier](https://zapier.com/)
* [n8n](https://n8n.io/)



## My First Make.com Automation

For my first Make.com scenario, I built a simple system to help create and manage a series of articles describing previous projects I've worked on.  All the content is stored in a single Google Sheet on Google Drive.
